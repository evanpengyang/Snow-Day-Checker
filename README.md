This is an independent project designed to check St. Thomas More Collegiate's and Burnaby School's websites for fresh news articles relating to snow days and transmitting the title and short description to Discord via integration/webhook.

The purpose of the project is to make it simpler for students to know if it is a snow day by sending them notifications without needing to check the websites.

Note: The project uses the Python library BeautifulSoup to scrape the HTML data from the websites.
